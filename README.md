# A Fast JavaScript Buddhabrot Renderer
### Created by Frank Force 2020

# [LIVE DEMO](https://killedbyapixel.github.io/Buddhabrot/)

This tool is capable of generating high resoluton buddhabrot images. Low quality images can render in only a few seconds but it takes a few hours to get high quality results with a low brightness value. The example was rendered at 7680x4320 resolution for over 24 hours!
